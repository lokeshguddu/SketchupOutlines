SDK package version (Release date): Change description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8 (4/4/2014):   Added SUGuidePointRef.

7 (3/6/2014):   Updated the Deprecated SkpReader SDK on Mac to read 2014-format
                skp files.

6 (1/15/2014):  Released API version 2.0
                Added SUModelSaveToFileWithVersion()
                Added enum SUModelVersion

5 (11/12/2013): Bumped API Version to 2.0 (alpha)
                Added SUFaceGetNumOpenings() and SUFaceGetOpenings()

4 (6/25/2013): Fixed compilation issues on Mac while building against the
               deprecated SketchupReader.framework. Updated the framework
               to be able to read 2013 files. Also added some files missing
               from deprecated/SkpWriter/Headers. (Sorry about these omissions). 
               
               Added back the old Mac example SkpStats (under
               deprecated\SkpReader\Examples) that illustrates how to read
               SU files from a stand-alone program (i.e. not as an exporter).
               
               Added missing SU_ERROR_INVALID_OUTPUT return values to code
               documentation comments for slapi *GetName() functions and others
               that return string data.

3 (5/31/2013): Fixed install paths of XmlExporter and XmlImporter plugin samples
               to link to slapi.framework as SketchUp does to prevent loader
               problems.

2 (5/23/2013): Updated deprecated SketchUpReader.dll to be able to read SU2013
               format files.
